# **Salifort Motors Employee Churn Prediction and Employee Retention Strategies**
---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

**Business Question:**  
> What factors are most likely to cause an employee to leave Salifort Motors?

The project was commissioned to analyze historical employee data to build a predictive model that classifies employees as likely to stay or leave, based on a variety of factors including performance, workload, salary, tenure, and more.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

- **File**: [`HR_capstone_dataset.csv`](./Raw-Dataset/HR_capstone_dataset.csv)
- **Target Variable**: `left` (binary: 1 if the employee left the company, 0 otherwise)
- **Key Features**:
  - `last_evaluation`
  - `number_project`
  - `tenure`
  - `overworked` (e.g., avg monthly hours)
  - `salary` level (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
  - `work_accident`
  - `promotion_last_5years`
  - and other HR attributes

## 🧪 Methodology (see [`Salifort-Project-Notebook.ipynb`](./Salifort-Project-Notebook.ipynb))

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Distribution plots for numeric features
- Countplots for categorical variables
- Correlation heatmaps

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Handling of imbalanced data
- Feature transformation and scaling

### 3. **Modeling Techniques**
Models were trained to predict the binary target `left`:

- **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier** (two variations with different hyperparameters)(see [`models`](./models))

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance (especially for tree-based models)

## ✅ Key Insights

(See [`Salifort-Employee-Retention-Executive-Summary.pdf`](./Executive-Summary/Salifort-Employee-Retention-Executive-Summary.pdf))

- **Top Predictive Features**:
  - `last_evaluation`
  - `number_project`
  - `tenure`
  - `overworked`
  - `salary_low`
  - `work_accident`

- **Best Model**: Random Forest (outperformed other classifiers)

- **Recommendations for HR**:
  - Cap the number of simultaneous projects.
  - Reward or promote long-tenured employees (especially 4+ years).
  - Address overworking concerns and clarify overtime policies.
  - Use proportionate evaluation methods tied to hours worked.
